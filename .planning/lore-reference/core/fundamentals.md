## Universe Overview

The galaxy consists of numbered **sectors**. A sector may contain any combination of the following entities:

- Planets  
- Ports  
- Other players  
- Empty ships  
- Aliens (Ferrengi, Federation Starships, etc.)  
- Mines  
- Message beacons  
- Fighters (your own, other players’, rogue mercenaries’, or Ferrengi‑controlled)

## Starting Ship and Defenses

- Every new player begins with a ship that carries **30 fighters**.  
- These fighters are available immediately for defense.

## Alignment, Ranks, and Commission

**Alignment points** determine a player’s standing with the Federation and unlock advanced assets.

**Commission**  
- A player becomes *commissioned* at **1,000 alignment**.  
- The **Imperial Star Ship (ISS)** becomes purchasable at **1,000 alignment**.

**Alignment‑gain methods (credits per point)**  

| Method                               | Credits per alignment point |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Posting rewards on evil players       | 1,000                      |
| Cross‑pod with an evil partner       | 0 (no credit cost)         |
| Paying taxes                         | 1,500 (most expensive)    |
| Building planets                      | 2,000 (slow)               |
| Killing evil traders/aliens (‑250 align, 200 figs) | ≈ 400 |
| Upgrading ports                      | 5,000 (high upfront)       |

> **Note:** Posting rewards is cheaper than paying taxes for alignment.

## Alignment‑Related Night‑Time Survival

- With **good alignment** and **< 1,000 experience**, you may stay overnight in Federation space if the **ships‑per‑sector limit** is not exceeded and you carry **fewer than 99 fighters**.  
- Exceeding either limit triggers an automatic tow at Extern.  
- **Cloaking devices** provide an alternative safe haven: cloaked ships cannot be attacked directly, but cloaks may fail after 24 hours (appearing as a density anomaly). Photon torpedoes decloak them.

## Home Sectors and Base Placement

- Choose an **out‑of‑the‑way sector** (often a dead‑end) for early bases to reduce exposure to traffic and hostile ports.  
- Avoid building bases directly between **Class 0** and **Class 9** ports.

### Bubbles and Tunnels

- **Bubbles** are clusters of interconnected tunnels that have a single entry point.  
- **Tunnels** are linear chains allowing **2‑warp** movement.  
- For expansion, locate a bubble or tunnel and develop a **dead‑end sector** (no port) to place new planets.  
- Good‑aligned corporations typically develop bubbles containing **H**, **O**, and **L** planets to maximize daily credit generation and fighter production.

## Planet Mechanics

### Planet Types, Ratios, and Production Limits

| Class | Ratio (Fuel/Org/Equ) | Max Colonists | Max Daily Fuel | Max Daily Org | Max Daily Equ | Max Daily Fighters |
|-------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| M (Earth)      | 3 / 7 / 13 | 30,000 | 5,000 | 2,142 | 1,153 | 829 |
| K (Desert)     | 2 / 100 / 500 | 40,000 | 10,000 | 200 | 40 | 682 |
| O (Oceanic)    | 20 / 2 / 100 | 200,000 | 5,000 | 50,000 | 1,000 | 3,733 |
| L (Mountain)  | 2 / 5 / 20 | 40,000 | 10,000 | 4,000 | 1,000 | 1,250 |
| C (Glacial)    | 50 / 100 / 500 | 100,000 | 1,000 | 500 | 100 | 64 |
| H (Volcanic)  | 1 / ‑ / 500 | 100,000 | 50,000 | 0 | 100 | 1,002 |
| U (Vapour/Gas) | ‑ / ‑ / ‑ | 3,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

- The **daily production** of FOE products follows a bell curve; maximum output occurs at **50 %** of the maximum colonist count.  
- Colonist counts **below 50 %** tend to increase, while those **above 50 %** tend to die off proportionally.  
- **Maximum planet population** is **twice** the optimal colonist count; excess colonists reduce production efficiency.

### Fighter Production Factors

Fighters are generated indirectly from the daily FOE production. Each planet class defines a **Fig factor** – the number of colonists required to produce one fighter for a given commodity.

| Class | Fuel Fig Factor | Organics Fig Factor | Equipment Fig Factor |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| M | 30 | 70 | 130 |
| K | 30 | 1,500 | 7,500 |
| O | 300 | 30 | 1,500 |
| L | 24 | 60 | 240 |
| C | 1,250 | 2,500 | 12,500 |
| H | 50 | 0 | 25,000 |
| U | ‑ | ‑ | ‑ |
